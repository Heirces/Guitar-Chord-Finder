## What is the definition of a chord?
A Chord is a group of **3** or more notes played together simultaneously.
"Power" Chords are groups of **2** notes played together; the root note and the perfect 5th.
Besides Power Chords, groups of 2 notes played together are not technically chords and are called an "interval" or "dyad"

## How are chords built?
Eloquently stated in Guitar Chords Analyzer [1] "All chords are based on a certain number of 3rds that are stacked over a root tone. Each one measured from the root, they form the 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc. Each of the stacked 3rds may be raised or lowered to a major/minor/augmented/diminished variant or substitute (e.g. sus4 instead of 3, 6 instead of 7), forming a chord type with its unique character."

## Intervals and their possible variants
There are 7 standard notes and 12 semitones in every key. The notes change with the key. What doesn't change is the measured semitone intervals between the notes. The traditional major/minor chord is built by a triad consisting of a Root Note, Major/Minor third and a Perfect fifth.
1 - Root Note -  AKA the "Tonic" **The base note of the chord**
2 
3 - Major/Minor third **Decides whether chord is major or minor**
4
5 - Perfect Fifth **Completes the triad**
6
7
8 - Octave

### Major or Minor Chord?
A chord being major or minor depends upon the amount of semitones between the root note and the 3rd interval. 
If the 3rd is 3 semitones from the root, the chord is minor.
If the 3rd is 4 semitones from the root, the chord is major.

### Interval Variants
1 - Root Note
3 - Sus2, m3, 3, Sus4
5 - b5, 5 #5
7 - b6, 6, dim7, 7, maj7
9 - b9, 9 , #9
11 - 11, #11
13 - b13, 13

### Interval Variant Semitones
###### Root
Root Note: 0 semitones

###### 3rd
Sus2: 2 semitones
Minor Third (m3): 3 semitones
Major Third (3): 4 semitones
Sus4: 5 semitones

###### 5th
Diminished Fifth (b5): 6 semitones
Perfect Fifth (5): 7 semitones
Augmented Fifth (#5): 8 semitones

###### 7th
Minor Sixth (b6): 8 semitones
Major Sixth (6): 9 semitones
Diminished Seventh (dim7): 9 semitones
Minor Seventh (b7): 10 semitones
Major Seventh (maj7): 11 semitones

###### 9th
Diminished Ninth (b9): 1 semitone (or 1 semitone above the root)
Major Ninth (9): 10 semitones
Augmented Ninth (#9): 11 semitones

###### 11th
Perfect Eleventh (11): 10 semitones
Augmented Eleventh (#11): 11 semitones

###### 13th
Diminished Thirteenth (b13): 8 semitones above the 7th
Major Thirteenth (13): 9 semitones above the 7th
