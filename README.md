# Guitar-Chord-Namer (Building Blocks)

## Find Out All Possible Names For A Guitar Chord Given 6 Or Less Notes Found On The Fretboard

## About
<p>
 This repository serves to document the development of the initial building blocks used to create a finalized version of a Guitar-Chord-Namer web application.
 Several building blocks being documented include:
 - Music Theory Research (How are chords built?)
 - Chord Building Algorithm
 - Final Version Ideas

 This project is sparked by my interest in music theory and being able to apply it to my own guitar playing. I find it particularly useful to put a name to a chord when writing music and my objective for this project is to create a web application that others want to use and benefit from.

 This project is heavily inspired by [Oolimo's Guitar Chord Finder](https://www.oolimo.com/en/guitar-chords/find)

## Objectives
###     1. Create an algorithm that returns the name of a chord when given 6 or less notes.
###     2. Choose a web framework to implement this algorithm upon. 
###     3. Deploy a web application using this algorithm
###     4. Set up a database that can store notes and chords in sound files
###     5. Add user account creation capability
###     6. Allow users to store chords
